# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification using Python

This project demonstrates how **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification** can be used to predict class labels based on **distance similarity**. KNN is a simple yet effective algorithm that classifies new data points based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors.

---

## 🔍 Objective
To implement and evaluate a **KNN Classifier** that predicts categorical outcomes by analyzing distance-based relationships.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** – data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – KNN model implementation and evaluation  

---

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – scaling, cleaning, encoding  
3. **Model Training** – KNN classifier  
4. **Prediction** – on test data  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  
6. **Visualization** – decision boundaries or neighborhood mapping  

---

## 📈 Results
The KNN model successfully classifies data using distance-based voting. With proper scaling, its accuracy improves significantly across datasets.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- How the **KNN algorithm** works  
- Importance of **feature scaling** in distance-based models  
- Choosing the best **K value**  
- Evaluating classification models using correct metrics
